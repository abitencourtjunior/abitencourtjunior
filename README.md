### Hi there! 😁

My name is Altamir Bitencourt Junior from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Full-Stack Developer with a focus on hardware integration.

In my free time, I like watching movies (🎞️) and series (📺), reading books (📚), listening to music (🎵), playing music instruments (🎷), finally, I like to philosophize about life with a nice coffee (☕).

Would you like to find me?
